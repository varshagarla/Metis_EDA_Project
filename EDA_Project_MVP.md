## Analysis of the decline of NYC MTA subway usage during peak months of COVID-19 &

* **Aim**: The goal of this project is to explore whether socioeconomic status had an impact on the relative decline of subway usage in different regions of NYC.
* **Preliminary Analysis**: To start exploring this goal, I aggregated the stations by income bracket (according to the median income of the station's zip code).
* Then, I found the daily entries over the 3 months for each income bracket by taking the sum of the daily entries for all stations within the income bracket.

* This plot shows the decline of subway ridership in the _lowest_ income bracket ("$1 under $25,000") over March, April, and May 2020

* This plot shows the decline of subway ridership in the _highest_ income bracket represented ("$100,000 under $200,000") over March, April, and May 2020

**Preliminary Findings**: Subway ridership declined by 47% in areas with the lowest income while subway ridership declined by 91% in areas with the highest
income from the first week of March to the last week of May 2020. This suggests that subway ridership did not decline uniformly but rather systematically
according to socioeconomic status. This can have implications on health disparities due to crowded subways and the spread of coronavirus.
